Scope determines where a variable or function is accessible in your code. There are three main types of scope in JavaScript:

Global Scope
A variable declared in the global scope is accessible anywhere in your code, both inside and outside functions or blocks.

Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.

Example:

var globalVar = "I am global";

function printGlobal() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
}

printGlobal(); // Output: "I am global"
console.log(globalVar); // Output: "I am global"



Key Point: Global variables can be accessed and modified from anywhere, which can sometimes lead to unintended side effects or bugs.
